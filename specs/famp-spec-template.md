# FAMP Implementation Specification

## High-Level Objective

- Build a scalable Facebook Account Management Platform that enables efficient management of multiple Facebook accounts using the `nodriver` library, featuring account isolation, cookie persistence, and a plugin system.

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Implement core browser management using `nodriver` with proper session persistence
- Create an account management system that enforces isolation and securely stores credentials
- Develop a plugin architecture that allows for modular feature extensions
- Establish a CLI interface for easy interaction with the platform
- Implement basic plugins for essential Facebook operations (login, feed interaction)

## Implementation Notes

- Use Python 3.12+ as specified in the pyproject.toml
- Leverage `nodriver` for all browser automation - a key requirement is to use this library exclusively
- Use `click` for CLI implementation (already in dependencies)
- Implement proper async handling with `asyncio` for concurrent operations
- Use `pydantic` for data validation and settings management
- Follow cookie persistence mechanism using `nodriver`'s save/load functionality
- Structure code to follow the component diagram in the requirements doc
- Store user credentials securely, avoiding plaintext passwords
- Design the plugin system to be extensible and follow the interface described in the requirements

## Context
### Beginning context
- pyproject.toml (Project configuration exists)
- main.py (Empty file that needs implementation)
### Ending context
- main.py (Implement core functionality)
- plugin.py (Create plugin system)
- Various modules for account management, browser handling, etc.
