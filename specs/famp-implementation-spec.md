# FAMP Implementation Specification

## High-Level Objective

- Complete the core functionality of the Facebook Account Management Platform (FAMP) by implementing missing components and enhancing existing features to enable efficient, cookie-based management of multiple Facebook accounts

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Create a comprehensive CLI interface using Click for intuitive user interaction
- Implement the main entry point to tie all components together
- Add configuration management using Pydantic
- Establish enhanced logging and monitoring
- Develop sample plugins for Facebook automation (feed scroller, post publisher)
- Improve cookie persistence to fully replace user data directory storage

## Implementation Notes

- Use cookies exclusively for session persistence (NOT user data directories)
- Follow async pattern established in existing code for all new implementations
- Maintain strict account isolation in all components
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use Pydantic for configuration validation
- Structure plugin samples to serve as templates for future plugin development
- Maintain compatibility with existing components (AccountManager, BrowserManager, PluginManager)
