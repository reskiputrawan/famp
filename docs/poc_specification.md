# FAMP POC Specification

> This specification details the implementation plan for the Facebook Account Management Platform POC.

## High-Level Objective

- Create a working Proof of Concept for FAMP that demonstrates automated Facebook account management with session persistence and plugin architecture using nodriver.

## Mid-Level Objectives

- Implement browser management with nodriver that supports multiple isolated Facebook accounts
- Create account management with credential storage and cookie persistence
- Build a plugin system for extensible functionality
- Implement a basic CLI interface
- Demonstrate session persistence across runs

## Implementation Notes

- Use Python 3.12+ with asyncio for concurrency
- Use nodriver for all browser automation
- Store account credentials in simple text files for the POC (encryption will come later)
- Store cookies using nodriver's cookie save/load functionality
- Follow modular design with clear class responsibilities

## Context

### Beginning context

- main.py with basic implementation
- Product requirements document
- Example code for account isolation and plugin system

### Ending context

- Fully functional POC with:
  - Complete package structure
  - Browser management with nodriver
  - Account management system
  - Plugin system
  - Basic CLI interface with Click
  - At least two working plugins (login and one more)

## Low-Level Tasks

1. Create package structure for FAMP

```
Create the proper Python package structure:
- famp/
  - __init__.py
  - browser.py (browser management)
  - account.py (account management)
  - plugin.py (plugin system)
  - cli.py (command line interface)
  - plugins/
    - __init__.py
    - login.py
    - profile.py
```

2. Implement browser manager

```
Create the browser manager module that:
- Manages browser instances with nodriver
- Provides isolated browser contexts for each account
- Handles cookie persistence
- Creates, retrieves, and closes browser instances
```

3. Implement account manager

```
Create the account manager module that:
- Stores and retrieves account credentials
- Lists, adds, and removes accounts
- Provides account information to plugins
```

4. Implement plugin system

```
Create the plugin system that:
- Provides a base Plugin class with standard interface
- Discovers and loads plugins
- Registers plugins with the system
- Facilitates running plugins with account context
```

5. Implement login plugin

```
Create the login plugin that:
- Automates Facebook login using nodriver
- Handles both fresh login and cookie-based sessions
- Detects and reports login success/failure
```

6. Implement profile plugin

```
Create the profile plugin that:
- Navigates to Facebook profiles
- Extracts basic profile information
- Serves as an example of plugin extensibility
```

7. Implement CLI interface

```
Create the command line interface that:
- Provides commands for account management
- Provides commands for running plugins
- Parses command line arguments using Click
- Implements the main entry point
```

8. Integrate everything in main module

```
Update the main module to:
- Initialize all components
- Provide the entry point for the application
- Handle proper cleanup on exit
```
